To activate the model, use the "IOT_steps_model_predict.ipynb" file.

Load all the pickle files into the main directory and use the function "predict(path)", where "path" is the full path to the CSV file.

The CSV file needs to be in the same format as was required in the data loading assignment in Part A.
